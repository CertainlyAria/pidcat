PID Cat with Filtering and Output Fixes 
=======

This is a fork of Jake Wharton's [PID Cat][1] that fixes two issues:
* Logs are not printed correctly which resulted byte prints instead of formatted and colored strings.
* Filtering is not working. Passing any argument to pidcat will result in empty output.

For Installation guide please refer to original [PID Cat][1] repo.
